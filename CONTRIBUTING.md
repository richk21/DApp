## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository's page on GitHub. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:

   ```

3. **Set Up Remote**: Change into the project's directory:
   ```shell
   cd <your-project-name>
   ```
   Connect your fork to the original repository:
   ```shell
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original-author>/<your-project-name>.git
   ```

4. **Create a Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch for your work. Name it in a way that reflects the nature of your contribution.
   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-new-feature

4. **Commit**: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

5. **Sync with Upstream**: Before submitting a pull request, ensure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the original repository.
   ```shell
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
